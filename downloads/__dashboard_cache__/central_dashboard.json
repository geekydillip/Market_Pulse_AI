        "Dear Samsung Support Team, I am facing a charging issue with my Samsung Galaxy A55 5G. The device automatically switches between Super Fast Charging and Fast Charging while plugged in. I visited the Samsung Care center, and they attempted to resolve the issue, but it persists. Finally, they suggested it might be a software glitch, as this problem has been reported by multiple users of the A55 5G. I am attaching a video as proof of the issue. Kindly review it and provide a solution, whether through a software update or another fix. Looking forward to your prompt response. Best regards, Vikas Kumar",
